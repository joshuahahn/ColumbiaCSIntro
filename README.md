# A Quick Introduction to CS @ Columbia


# COMS 3203: Discrete Mathematics
## By Ayaan Ali (CC'26 Math & CS) 

### General Description
Discrete Mathematics (often called "Discrete") is one of the more unique courses in the CS Core. There's little programming involved (in some sections there's none) and theoretical computer science takes center stage. Topics you might learn in discrete mathematics include the basics of number theory, modular arithmetic, set theory, mathematical logic, proof-writing strategies (induction, contradiction, contraposition, uniqueness, etc...), rudimentary graph theory, statistics and probability, equivalence relations, and cryptography. 

### Why is this course important? 
Upper-level computer science courses such as '''COMS 3261''' Computer Science Theory or '''CSOR E4231''' Analysis of Algorithms or I are rooted in theoretical concepts. Discrete teaches the "language" to understand theoretical computer science. It teaches the core mathematical principles that underline computer science. Moreover, many Discrete professors use LaTeX for their homework assignments. LaTeX is a word-processing software like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, except it's typed in mark-up language (similar to HTML). LaTeX is the standard document preparation software for higher mathematics, computer science, and in STEM research and academia.
