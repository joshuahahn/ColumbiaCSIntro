# A Quick Introduction to CS @ Columbia


# COMS 3203: Discrete Mathematics
## By Ayaan Ali (CC'26 Math & CS) 

### General Description
Discrete Mathematics (often called "Discrete") is one of the more unique courses in the CS Core. There's little programming involved (in some sections there's none) and theoretical computer science takes center stage. Topics you might learn in discrete mathematics include the basics of number theory, modular arithmetic, set theory, mathematical logic, proof-writing strategies (induction, contradiction, contraposition, uniqueness, etc...), rudimentary graph theory, statistics and probability, equivalence relations, and cryptography. 

### Why is this course important? 
Upper-level computer science courses such as COMS 3261 Computer Science Theory or CSOR E4231 Analysis of Algorithms or I are rooted in theoretical concepts. Discrete teaches the "language" to understand theoretical computer science. It teaches the core mathematical principles that underline computer science. Moreover, many Discrete professors use LaTeX for their homework assignments. LaTeX is a word-processing software like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, except it's typed in mark-up language (similar to HTML). LaTeX is the standard document preparation software for higher mathematics, computer science, and in STEM research and academia. 

### Professors 
Professors can vary for Discrete Math (I took it with a graduate student named Melanie Subbiah), but usually the two professors who wind up teaching the course are Tony Dear (in the fall) and Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi (in the Spring). Reviews for each professor can be found on culpa.info which is operated by Columbia Spectator. 

### FAQ
- Do I need Calculus for Discrete?
-     No! The only prerequisite for Discrete is one introductory programming class. No higher mathematics experience is assumed, but having some maturity with college mathematics wouldn't hurt.  
- How much programming is in Discrete?
  This is dependent on the professor. My Discrete course was entirely theoretical with almost no programming. Prof. Dear's course, on the other hand, emphasizes writing concept implementations in Python. However, generally, Discrete has far less programming than courses like COMES 1004 or COMS 3134 which are programming-focused.
- When should I take Discrete?
  It's quite common to take Discrete after COMS 1004. A great many students take it alongside COMS 3134 Data Structures & Algorithms or COMS 3137 Advanced Programming. Taking Discrete early opens up the door to higher level theoretical computer science courses. However, ensure that you've taken at least one programming class at Columbia before attempting Discrete.
